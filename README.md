Problem definition

AirBnB is an online marketplace and hospitality service for short-term lodging, it was founded in 2008 by a group of three men Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk as AirBed & Breakfast, As the years went by, the share of professional hospitality providers has significantly increased and is now crowding out the private providers, threatening AirBnBâ€™s value proposition of offering unique service and personal touch. Because of this, the marketing department decided to run a campaign to attract more private providers. To achieve this, they requested me as a senior data analylst to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the Rental room and can help hosts, travelers, and also the business in devising profitable strategie.

The data is collected from the AirBnB website. The considered dataset contains 74111 entries with 11 of both dependant and independent variables, The data contains information about the different types of rental rooms offered by Airbnb over a fixed period of time.

Univariate analysis

This is the most basic form of data analysis technique, we shall perform it to understand the data contained by individual variable(one variable), To do this, we shall first use describe function to get the descriptive statistics of continuous variables then use the different plots to help us carry out the analysis.

Bivariate analysis

This analysis is slightly more analytical than Univariate analysis. We will use it to undertake comparsion between the data. To acheive this, we will first use the corr function to construct the correlation matrix to understand the relationship between the contionuous variables.
